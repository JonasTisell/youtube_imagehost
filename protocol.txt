- YouTube profile picture-url parameters Documentation-
(These are also usable in Picasa, Blogger and Google+ image-links, as they all use the Google Image Host)

 Rules

If image is 5000px*5000px, GIF will be disabled
Needs to have a slash in the end or all parameters will be ignored
Trying unexisting parameters makes the image 404
Highest quality saved on server is 797x797

 Default parameters (set in all profile pictures)

s            =  size, proceeded by a integer (defaults to 512x512 if not set - can also use w[size] and h[size])
k            =  Makes GIF show a play-button (if "no" isn't set)
no           =  Stops GIF from moving (needs "rj")
rj           =  makes image JPG (when not set, image gets changed to the original filetype)
c            =  Allows image to be larger than 797x797 pixels
c0xffffffff  =  Unknown
mo           =  Unknown

 Other parameters

g            =  Shows the XML used to render the profile picture (TileInfo) - also ignores other parameters
fcrop64      =  Doesn't do anything on profile pictures, but setting it to 2 shows an alert-sign (from banner-parameters)
d            =  Autodownloads image (Credit to Codesiderations)
p            =  Makes the image bigger than the size, and crops it
a / mm       =  Shows the old default profile-picture (blue square with a star inside) - Always shows if parameter starts with mm (can have anything behind)
h (no int)   =  Puts img in a html-page
cc           =  Makes image circular
I            =  Redirects url to googleusercontent.com - once redirected it shows client doesn't have permission. (removing I then makes it work)
U            =  Does same as -I, but url is different (removing U then makes it work)
ft           =  Unknown
t            =  Starting parameter with -t allows you to write anything after it without it breaking (e.g. "-tHELLO" won't break it)
